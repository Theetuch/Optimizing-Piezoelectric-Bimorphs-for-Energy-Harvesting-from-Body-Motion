**Optimizing Piezoelectric Bimorphs for Energy Harvesting from Body Motion: Finger Movement in Computer Mouse Clicking**
Welcome to the repository for my study on energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials. This research focuses on capturing energy from finger movements during computer mouse clicking.

**Overview**
This repository contains the MATLAB code used in my experiments, along with raw data files organized in respective folders.

**Code Structure**
MATLAB Code: The main scripts and functions used for data analysis and visualization.
Raw Data: Experimental data files collected during the study.
Notes
The code may appear complex and unstructured at times. However, this is an opportunity to explore and understand the project.

**Contribution**
I invite you to explore the code and data. If you find ways to enhance or optimize the code, your contributions are highly appreciated. May your work in this field yield even more impressive results, and may you find the process both challenging and rewarding.

Thank you for your interest in this project.

Best regards
